    <h3><b>about me</b></h3>
    <p>
        I'm a joint Ph.D. candidate from the University of Toronto and the University of Melbourne, where I am advised by 
        Prof. <a href="https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~weiyu/">Wei Yu</a>, 
        Prof. <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/jse">Jamie Evans</a>,  
        and Dr. <a href="http://zhujingge.com/">Jingge Zhu</a>. 
        My dissertation focuses on the information-theoretic limit 
        and the design of machine learning algorithms for wireless systems. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My doctoral research is supported by competitive awards such as Bell Graduate Scholarship and Melbourne Research Scholarship. 
        I received my M.A.Sc. and B.A.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto.

        <small><b> hear me pronounce my - family name, -:
                <audio id="player" src="assets/audio/Duong.m4a"></audio>
                <a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('player').play();event.preventDefault();"><i
                        class='fa fa-volume-up'></i></a> </b>
            <span>
                Saying <b><em>"Chu-ng" </em></b> will get you close.
                Most people pronounce it like "Zain" or "Zang", which I'm fine with.
